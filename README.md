Hawkes Modeling of Order-Flow Imbalance (OFI) — NSE Tick Data

This project analyzes high-frequency trading behavior in NSE equities using bivariate Hawkes processes.
We model buyer-initiated vs seller-initiated trades, quantify clustering and endogeneity, and relate these patterns to market microstructure concepts such as liquidity, execution pressure, and short-horizon order-flow imbalance (OFI).
